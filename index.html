            “Sweeping the Clouds Away” is an honest and often humorous account
            of growing up as a gay adolescent and teenager in the 1950s and 60s.
          </p>
          <p>
            The author’s emotional highs and lows were complemented by spiritual
            lifelines he drew from America’s show-business past and its
            entertainments of the day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accounts of his loving, complicated family, a solid friendship, and
            a series of remarkable opportunities are enhanced by persistent
            life-lessons of optimism and, in hindsight, the generous hand of a
            higher power.
